#### Simple, static onepage-website about a hobby or interest I like (Counter-Strike)

* I learned about the &#60;details&#62; tag (being able to click to show/hide), which I´ve previously done with CSS instead.
* I learned about adding subject directly into an &#60;a&#62;-mailto:
* I learned about using tel: in an &#60;a&#62;
* I learned to use &#60;abbr&#62; everywhere, which I usually don´t do.
* I learned how nested &#60;ul&#62; looks like.

###### Otherwise, I didn´t learn anything new. It was just a repetition of things I already know.
