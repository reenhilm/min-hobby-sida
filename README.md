# min-hobby-sida
Simple, static onepage-website about a hobby or interest I like (Counter-Strike)

I learned about the <details> tag (being able to click to show/hide), which I´ve previously done with CSS instead.
I learned about adding subject directly into an <a>-mailto:
I learned about using tel: in an <a>
I learned to use <abbr> everywhere, which I usually don´t do.
I learned how nested <ul> looks like.

Otherwise, I didn´t learn anything new. It was just a repetition of things I already know.
