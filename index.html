            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Counter-Strike is a highly popular first-person shooter (FPS) game that has captured the attention of players worldwide
            since its initial release in 1999. Known for its tactical gameplay, Counter-Strike pits two teams—Terrorists and
            Counter-Terrorists—against each other in high-stakes matches. The game demands strategy, teamwork, and precision, with
            objectives like planting or defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, or eliminating the enemy team.
            
            <p>I find it appealing due to it's competitive nature. The adrenaline of fast-paced rounds, and thriving community with active esports tournaments. It takes me away from problemsolving for a short while, thus giving my brain rest. I've made alot of <em>friends</em> (are they really?) whilst playing this game.</p>
