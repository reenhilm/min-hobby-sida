            <p>Counter-Strike is a highly popular <abbr title="first-person shooter">FPS</abbr> game that has captured the attention of players worldwide
            since its initial release in 1999. Known for its tactical gameplay, Counter-Strike pits two teams—Terrorists and
            Counter-Terrorists—against each other in high-stakes matches. The game demands strategy, teamwork, and precision, with
            objectives like planting or defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, or eliminating the enemy team.
            <h3>Why I choose Counter-Strike</h3>
            <p>I find it appealing due to it's competitive nature. The adrenaline of fast-paced rounds, and thriving community with active esports tournaments. It takes me away from problemsolving for a short while, thus giving my brain rest. I've made alot of <em>friends</em> (are they really?) whilst playing this game.</p>

            <p>If you're new to Counter-Strike, begin by playing offline against <abbr title="Software Operated Players">bots</abbr> to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and
            maps. Gradually transition to casual matches with friends or join beginner-friendly servers to learn the ropes in a less
            pressured environment. Watching professional matches on platforms like Twitch or YouTube can also provide valuable
            insights into advanced tactics and strategies. Lastly, embrace the journey of improvement. It's a game where every match
            teaches you something new!</p>
